=head1 NAME

Mail::Ezmlm::Archive - Object Methods for Ezmlm-Idx Archives

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Mail::Ezmlm::Archive;
 $archive = Mail::Ezmlm::Archive->new('/path/to/list/folder');
 
 $message_count = $archive->getcount;
 @available_months = $archive->getmonths;
 $threads = $archive->getthreads('200304');

=head1 ABSTRACT

Mail::Ezmlm::Archive is designed to provide an object interface to the message 
archives maintained by the ezmlm-idx software. See the ezmlm web page for a 
complete description of that software: <http://www.ezmlm.org>.

This version is designed to work with ezmlm 0.53 and ezmlm-idx 0.40.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Setting up a new Archive object

	use Mail::Ezmlm::Archive;
	$archive = Mail::Ezmlm::Archive->new('/path/to/list/folder');

=head2 Changing which list the Archive object points at

	$archive->setlist('/full/path/to/other/list');

=head2 Getting count of archived messages

	$message_count = $archive->getcount;

Actually the getcount methods reads message count from DIR/num file, so we'd 
better consider the result as count of distributed messages instead of archived.

=head2 Getting a list of months

	@available_months = $archive->getmonths;

This returns an array of strings in the 'YYYYMM' format, such as '200304', which 
represent months for which we have archived messages.

=head2 Getting a list of threads in a given month

	$threads = $archive->getthreads('200304');

This method returns a reference to an array, whose elements are hashes with these 
keys:

=item subject

The subject of the thread, as archived in DIR/archived/threads/$month

=item count

Count of messages in the thread

=item offset

Id of first message in the thread

=item id

Thread Id.

=item date

The date of last message in the thread, as archived in DIR/archived/threads/$month

=head2 Getting list of messages in a given thread

	$messages = $archive->getthread('nknmgklhcgijmbonmbkk');

This method returns a reference to a hash, which has two keys: 'subject' and 'messages'.
The former contains the subject of the first message in the thread. The latter is a 
reference to an array, whose elements are hashes with these keys:

=item id

Message Id for retrieving.

=item month

Month of the message, in 'YYYYMM' format

=item authorid

Author Id

=item author

Full value of the 'From:' line

=head2 Retrieving a message

	$message = $archive->getmessage('52');

=head1 CACHING

All opened files are cached by default, so that we do not need to overload the 
filesystem for doing normal listing and browsing operations. However, caching 
can be disabled to reduce memory usage:

	$archive->nocache;

Then, to enable it again:

	$archive->cache;

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item *

No methods for author-based browsing.

=item *

Not enough object oriented, maybe? :-)

=head1 AVAILABILITY

You can download the latest version from CPAN ( http://search.cpan.org ).
